Adapter allows programming the KR573RF2 UVEPROM chip with a TL866 programmer.

The adapter use 24V-26V external programming voltage from a laboratory regulated power supply.

You may need to select 2732 in the programmer settings and duplicate the firmware.

My programmer can't flash the KR573RF2. It can only flash the K573RF5, which is 
almost identical to the KR573RF2. Internet users claim that newer versions of 
the TL866 can flash the KR573RF2.

AS IS. No guarantees.
